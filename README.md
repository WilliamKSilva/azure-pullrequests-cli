<strong style="font-size: 15px">Azure DevOps Pull Requests Bubbletea TUI</strong>

Hey, you, yes you! The one lost about opened Pull Requests from a DevOps project! I can help you!

This TUI application was developed to help you keep track of Azure DevOps projects avaiable Pull Requests,
directly from the terminal, yes without a tab on the browser, just you and your old friend terminal.

<strong>How to use</strong>

Well is actualy very simple, execute the App and provide some data (I told that is simple).

Detailing a little more, you'll need to provide your Azure DevOps organization name
and a PAT (Personal Access Token), you can learn how to get one in the official docs <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows">PAT Docs</a>

After providing that information you will be asked to select a project and after a Pull Requests list from that project
repositories will be displayed.

Now you can just enjoy! If you want to refresh your Pull Requests list just press "r" in your keyboard.

Feel free to open issues or ask for some changes/improvements, I will do my best to help!

The TUI is in a very simple state, but with some ideas I think that some cool things can be done to make this Azure DevOps things easier.
